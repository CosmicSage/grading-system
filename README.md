# sag3x-classro0m
A knock off of Google Classroom. A Django project

## My Thoughts & Motivation
There are probably some vulnerabilties in this "web app" since the project wasn't polished to a finish as it didn't feel all that interesting after I figured out the correct model for the app.

## Installation
The Only dependency is just Django tbh. I used 'django-livereload-server' for a while but later spit it out of even the dev mode.

```bash
pip install Django;
```

## Usage
First setup a SQLite db file with:
```bash
python manage.py migrate
```
Now Start the server
```bash
python manage.py runserver 5000
```

## Contribution Encouragement
NOGAF I know.
